We must remember all the sacrifices veterans have made for us. They were the ones who stood up for our rights and for our freedom. They come back from war shells of what they used to be, injured physically and mentally. For this we must honor their sacrifices. 
  While we are reading this there are 300,000 homeless veterans on the streets, over 1.4 million veterans are at risk of becoming homeless. While we are reading this a veteran is losing his family.
<p></p><p>
When soldiers come back home many of them are affected by Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder which an estimated 460,000 veterans suffer from, Substance Abuse, Homelessness, Disability and Health/Illness Issues, Unemployment, Poverty, Educational Deficit, Social Anxiety, Family Issues and Anger Management Challenges. Every 2 hours a veteran takes his own life. Many of these issues can be attributed to what they've seen and done in the line of duty. As well as the extreme readjustment.
